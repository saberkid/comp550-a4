Federal government orders Canada Post to permanently cease delivery of controversial tabloid.
The federal government has ordered Canada Post to permanently cease delivering a controversial Toronto-based tabloid that has been criticized for promoting hatred against Jews, visible minorities, women and LGBTQ Canadians.
In June 2016, the government issued an interim order to stop delivery of Your Ward News to some 300,000 households through Canada Post¡¯s unaddressed bulk mail.
After considering the recommendations of an independent board of review on the matter, Carla Qualtrough, the minister responsible for the post office, has now made that order final. The public services and procurement minister says her decision is consistent with the law and the government¡¯s support for diversity and inclusiveness.
Last fall, the tabloid¡¯s publisher, LeRoy St. Germaine, and editor-in-chief, James Sears, were each charged with two counts of wilful promotion of hatred against an identifiable group, namely Jews and women.
