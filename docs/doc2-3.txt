Three dead in Leduc workplace accident.
Three people are dead after a workplace accident in Leduc, Mayor Bob Young said.
Police, firefighters and emergency crews responded to Millennium Cryogenic Technologies on Thursday around 2:30 p.m.

It¡¯s unclear what happened at the worksite in the Leduc Business Park, but the mayor confirmed three people died.
¡°On behalf of Leduc City Council and administration, I want to express our deepest condolences to the co-workers and families affected by this tragic incident,¡± he said in a statement.
Young said the situation is contained and there are no risks to the public.
Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) and RCMP are investigating.
