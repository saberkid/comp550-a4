B.C. man lucky to be alive after several days trapped in his truck.
A young man is recovering in hospital after a harrowing experience on Vancouver Island.
Duncan Moffat, 23, was recently reported missing after being out of touch from his family for over a week.
The reason for his lack of communication is that Moffat¡¯s truck went off a cliff and the 23-year-old was pinned in the vehicle with a broken femur for several days.
His uncle, Bill Macnab, told reporters that Moffat survived on a bag of apples he¡¯d picked at his dad¡¯s house in Sayward.
After several days inside the vehicle, he was lucky enough to find a bottle of Gatorade as well.
The trapped man was eventually discovered by a hunter who immediately called 911, beginning a rescue that took several hours.
Jaws of Life were needed to cut away the drivers¡¯ side of the truck and extract Moffat, who suffered the broken femur, broken ribs and a shoulder, a bruised vertebrae in his back and a lacerated spleen and liver.
While he was out of touch with family for closer to 10 days, Macnab believes his nephew¡¯s ordeal trapped inside the truck was five days long.
Moffat¡¯s grandfather described the hunter¡¯s chance of discovering the wreckage as one in a million.
